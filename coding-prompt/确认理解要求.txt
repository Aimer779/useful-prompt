"Can you please re-articulate to me the concrete and specific requirements I have given you using your own words, include what those specific requirements are and for each requirement what actions you need to take, what steps you need to take to implement my requirements, and a short plain text description of how you are going to complete the task, include how you will use of Sub-Agents and what will be done in series and what can be done in parallel. Also, re-organise the requirements into their logical & sequential order of implementation including any dependancies, and finally finish with a complete TODO list, then wait for my confirmation."
您能否用您自己的语言重新阐述一下我给您的具体需求？包括这些具体需求是什么，针对每个需求您需要采取哪些行动，您需要采取哪些步骤来实现我的要求，以及用简单的文字描述一下您将如何完成任务，包括您将如何使用子代理，哪些任务将按顺序执行，哪些任务可以并行执行。此外，请将需求重新组织成逻辑和连续的执行顺序，包括所有依赖关系，最后完成一份完整的待办事项清单，然后等待我的确认。
